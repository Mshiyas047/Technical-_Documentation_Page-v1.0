                Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
                It is used for:

                Python QuickStart
            </h1>

            <p>
                Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed. The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:
            </p>

            <p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py
                </code>
            </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file. Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.
            </p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                <code>
                    print("Hello, World!")
                </code>
                </pre>
            </p>

            </h1>

            <p>
                Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line
            </p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                <code>
                    >>> print("Hello, World!") Hello, World!
                </code>
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:
            </p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py

                Python Indentation
            </h1>

            <p>
                Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
            </p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                <code>
                    if 5 > 2: 
                    print("Five is greater than two!")
                </code>
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
            </p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                <code>
                    Syntax Error: 
                    if 5 > 2: print("Five is greater than two!")
                </code>
                </pre>  
            </p>

            <p>
                The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.

            <p>
                Comments can be used to explain Python code. 
                <br>
                Comments can be used to make the code more readable. 
                <br>
                Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

                Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
            </p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                <code>

            <h1>
                Multi Line Comments
            </h1>

            <p>
                Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
                 <br>
                To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
            </p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                <code>
                    #This is a comment 
                    #written in 
                    #more than just one line 
                    print("Hello, World!")
                </code>
                 </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string. 
                <br>
                Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, 
                <br> 
                and place your comment inside it:
            </p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                <code>
                """ 
                This is a comment
                written in 
                more than just one line 
                """ 
                print("Hello, World!")
                </code>
                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.

            <p>
                Variables are containers for storing data values.
                 <br>
                Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
                 <br>
                A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
            </p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                <code>
                x = 5 
                y = "John" 
                print(x) 
                print(y)

            </p>

            <p>
                Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
            </p>

            <p>
                <code>
                x = 4 # x is of type int 
                x = "Sally" # x is now of type str

                A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character</li>
                <li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
                <li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )</li>
                <li>Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)</li>
            </ol>
